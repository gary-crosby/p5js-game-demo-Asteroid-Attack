# Asteroid Attack!

**Asteroid Attack!** is a simple retro-inspired space shooter game demo where you defend your spaceship from incoming asteroids.

The game aesthetics were loosely inspired by some early video games which had simple, vector-based graphics and a limited colour palette.

## Notes

I created this project for my post-secondary students who, in one course, use p5.js to create a game, a puzzle, etc. The project is intended to be a feature-limited demo of a simple game that can be created using p5.js. Because it's a demo for students, some of the comments are directed towards them.

It was a quick build so it contains some sloppy or inefficient code. And to make it more fun it could use a few additional gameplay elements. But it works well enough for its intended purpose.

The game must be run from a server.
